# Barcode Scanning Attendance System in Python
* As part of my second-semester mini project in Python, I developed a program that functions as an attendance system. It operates by scanning the barcode found on an individual's identity card.
* As part of the development process, I created a Python file that serves as a module for the main project file. This module contains several important code snippets that are essential for the proper functioning of the project. By creating a separate module file, it becomes easier to manage and organize the code, making it more modular and maintainable. 
* The project is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created using tkinter, which enables the students and faculty members of the Cyber Security Batch at my University to perform various functions such as adding, viewing, and modifying attendance, and accessing important databases.
* To decode the barcode, the project utilizes the pyzbar library and employs an SVM Classifier for accurate and efficient recognition. Furthermore, OpenCV is utilized to capture the barcode and process the images. These tools and techniques enable the system to quickly and accurately extract information from the barcodes and match it with the relevant student or faculty member.
* For the databases, the project uses Excel files, which are commonly used and easily accessible by the majority of users. The Excel files store important data such as student and faculty information, and attendance records. By utilizing Excel files, the project provides a simple yet effective solution for managing the databases, making it easy for users to modify and access the data as required.
